Convert HTML to editable Figma layers. No plugin needed, just paste.

```ts
import { createFigmaConverter } from "@figit/dom-to-figma";

const figma = createFigmaConverter();

const result = await figma.convert({
  element: document.getElementById("design"),
  width: 1280,
  height: 800,
  name: "Hero",
});

await navigator.clipboard.write([result.toClipboardItem()]);
```

Paste in Figma with **Cmd+V** / **Ctrl+V**. Done.

## What it does

Walks a real DOM tree, reads computed styles, and produces what Figma reads on paste. Text becomes editable text; images, vectors, gradients, shadows, borders, and form placeholders all carry over. Layouts arrive as **native Figma auto-layout** by default — flex, block flow, wrap, and grid become real stacks, with per-container fallback to absolute positioning when a layout can't be reproduced exactly. Opt out with `createFigmaConverter({ layout: "absolute" })`.

Used in production by [Sleek](https://sleek.design) to copy generated designs straight from the browser into Figma.
